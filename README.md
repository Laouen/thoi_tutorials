# thoi_tutorials
Tutorials of how to use THOI library.

## Folder Structure and Dependencies

### notebooks
Contains the Jupyter notebooks used to generate the figures using the raw data and the result data.

### data
Contains the raw data from the anesthesia and the 920 datasets, as well as random data with different sample sizes.

### results
Contains the scripts' results in TSV files. These results include:
- Run time by order of interaction for all libraries.
- Run time by sample size for all libraries.
- Anesthesia HOI computations using THOI.

These results are generated by the scripts in the `scripts` folder and are shown in the paper by the figures in the notebooks.

### scripts
Contains the scripts to generate the results mentioned above.

## Running the Scripts and Notebooks

### Order of Execution
If you want to generate the results again, follow this order:
1. Run the scripts in the `scripts` folder.
2. Run the notebooks in the `notebooks` folder.

However, this is not necessary as the results are already generated and can be used directly from the notebooks without re-running the scripts.

### how to run the scripts
To run the scripts, you need to have the conda environment set up with the dependencies of requirements.txt. Once the conda environment is set up, you can run the scripts using the instructions on the README inside the scripts folder.
